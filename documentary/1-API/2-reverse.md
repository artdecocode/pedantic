### Reverse Order

To print in reverse order, the `reverse` option can be set. This feature could be useful when writing a blog, for example, as date 23 will follow 22, and in the output it will be printed first.

_With a simpler directory structure:_

%TREE example/simple-test%

_It could be printed in reverse:_

%EXAMPLE: example/reverse, ../src => pedantry%
%FORK-markdown example/reverse%

%~ width="15"%
