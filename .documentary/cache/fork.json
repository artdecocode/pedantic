Would you be so kind as to give a little thought to the question of what\nyour good would be doing if evil did not exist, and how the earth would look if\nthe shadows were to disappear from it?”\n\n## 2-believe.md: Mikhail Bulgakov, The Master and Margarita\n\n“I believe you!' the artiste exclaimed finally and extinguishes his gaze. 'I do!\nThese eyes are not lying! How many times have I told you that your basic error\nconsists in underestimating the significance of the human eye. Understand that\nthe tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes - never! A sudden question is put\nto you, you don't even flinch, in one second you get hold of yourself and know\nwhat you must say to conceal the truth, and you speak quite convincingly, and\nnot a wrinkle on your face moves, but - alas - the truth which the question\nstirs up from the bottom of your soul leaps momentarily into your eyes, and it's\nall over! They see it, and you're caught!”\n\n## 3-brick.md: Mikhail Bulgakov, The Master and Margarita\n\n“The brick is neither here nor there,' interrupted the stranger in an imposing\nfashion, 'it never merely falls on someone's head from out of nowhere. In your\ncase, I can assure you that a brick poses no threat whatsoever. You will die\nanother kind of death.\"\n\n'And you know just what that will be?' queried Berlioz with perfectly\nunderstandable irony, letting himself be drawn into a truly absurd conversation.\n'And can you tell me what that is?'\n\n'Gladly,' replied the stranger. He took Berlioz's measure as if intending to\nmake him a suit and muttered something through his teeth that sounded like 'One,\ntwo.. Mercury in the Second House... the moon has set... six-misfortune...\nevening-seven...' Then he announced loudly and joyously, 'Your head will be cut\noff!”\n\n## 11-to-live.md: Friedrich Nietzsche\n\n> To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.\n\n## footer.md: Copyright\n\n[source](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/876183?page=2)\n",
